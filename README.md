# Brotpfli
## Automatically compresses your files for the web (.gz and .br)
Brotpfli uses the highly optimized [Brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli) and [Zopfli](https://github.com/google/zopfli) (by Google) to generate the .gz and .br archives corresponding to each of your files.

.gz and .br files can be used by web servers (for example: Nginx) to increase page loading speed, improve page indexation, and spare some bytes for the planet.

Brotpfli only creates .gz files if they are smaller than the original file.

Brotpfli only creates .br files if they are smaller than both the original and the .gz files.
## Windows installer + Brotli and Zopfli Windows binaries
Built with XML, using [FileMill](https://FileMill.net).
